# Overview
This project implements an LLM router inspired by Chatbot Arena and the Prompt-to-Leaderboard (P2L) framework. The router automatically selects the most suitable language model for a given prompt based on preference data and routing algorithms.

Built on the Bradleyâ€“Terry ranking model and Arena-style human feedback, our system enables efficient model selection, performance evaluation, and adaptive routing. It can be used for benchmarking, ensemble systems, or real-time deployment scenarios requiring prompt-to-model matching.
